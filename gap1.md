**Identifying the Gap: Missing Marcantonio Chiariniâ€™s Portrait on Wikidata**

- **What is the Gap?**

This project revealed a noticeable deficiency within Wikidata: some entries are missing portrait images (P18). While exploring entries of historical italian regional artists, we found out that Marcantonio Chiarini had no associated portrait image on Wikidata

- **Why did we choose this Gap?**

Being a relevant person in the artistic field, and more precisely a significant figure in Italian art history, the lack of important information such as the portrait underestimates his importance, and the recognition he deserves

- **How did we identify the Gap? (Methodology)**

To pinpoint the gap on Wikidata, we utilized a SPARQL query. Specifically, we designed a query to investigate how the image property (P18) is associated with both painters. By incorporating the 'ORDER BY' clause, we were able to effectively highlight any missing data and identify which painter the gap pertains to.
