The objective of this project was to explore the Knowledge Graph Wikidata using SPARQL queries, with the aim of identifying and adding relevant missing information. The research on two lesser-known painters - Marcantonio Chiarini and Francesco Paolo Michetti - provided the starting point for our project, as we found that their Wikidata pages presented several information gaps. 

First, we queried Wikidata for knowledge gaps using SPARQL and we uncovered missing data regarding their artistic movement, country of citizenship, portraits and work location. Then, we employed three Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral AI) to generate RDF triples to cover these gaps. To prompt the models, we used three prompting techniques: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain of thought prompting. As a result, we often obtained triples that contained errors related to the entity IDs or the property IDs. We manually corrected them according to Wikidata ontology. 

In conclusion, we observed that LLMs can facilitate the enrichment of a Knowledge Graph, especially in the the creation of RDF triples. Nevertheless, human intervention still proves essential to verify and correct the outputs generated by the models.
