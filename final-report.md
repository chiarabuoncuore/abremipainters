The objective of this project was to explore the Knowledge Graph <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikidata</a> using SPARQL queries, with the aim of identifying and understanding how to eventually add relevant missing information to specific elements pertaining to a chosen topic. The research on two lesser-known italian painters, <a href="https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/marc-antonio-chiarini_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/" target="_blank">Marcantonio Chiarini</a> and <a href="https://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-paolo-michetti_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/" target="_blank">Francesco Paolo Michetti</a>, provided the starting point for our project, as we found that their Wikidata pages presented several information gaps. 

First, we queried Wikidata for knowledge gaps using SPARQL and we uncovered missing data regarding their artistic portraits, movement, country of citizenship, and work location. Then, we employed three Large Language Models (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/chat" target="_blank">Mistral AI</a>) to first of all retrieve the missing information, which we did by employing three different prompting techniques: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zero-shot prompting</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">few-shot prompting</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chain-of-thought prompting</code>. Additionally, LLMs were askedto generate RDF triples to explain how to hypothetically cover these gaps. As a result, we often obtained triples that contained errors related to the Q-IDs or the property IDs. We manually corrected them according to Wikidata ontology by cross-checking the KG itself. 

In conclusion, we observed that LLMs can facilitate the enrichment of a Knowledge Graph, especially in the the creation of RDF triples. Nevertheless, human intervention still proves essential to verify and correct the outputs generated by the models.
