# Marcantonio Chiarini and Francesco Paolo Michetti
We intentionally selected these painters because they embody the cultural roots of our group. Half of us come from Emilia Romagna, while the other half come from Abruzzo. This regional connection inspired us to explore artists linked to these two Italian regions. Moreover, both Chiarini and Michetti are relatively underrated and remain largely unknown to most people outside specialized art circles. Despite their significant contributions to Italian art, they have not received the widespread recognition they deserve.

# Goal of the project
By focusing on these two painters, we aim not only to celebrate our regional identities but also to bring greater awareness to their artistic achievements. Our goal is to enrich the knowledge graph Wikidata about these artists, which could perhaps contribute to a broader appreciation of Italyâ€™s rich and diverse artistic heritage. In doing so, we hope to fill a gap in common knowledge and encourage others to rediscover these important, yet overlooked, figures.
