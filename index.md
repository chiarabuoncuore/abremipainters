title: Where Art Meets Data – Rediscovering the Overlooked
description: A research on the regional italian painters Francesco Paolo Michetti and Marcantonio Chiarini
---

## Introduction
In this KE4H project, we research the comprehensive Knowledge Graph Wikidata and look for available information on regional italian painters **Marcantonio Chiarini (1652–1730)** and **Francesco Paolo Michetti (1851–1929)**. Upon identification of gaps in chosen information and visual elements (an image depicting the figures, artistic movements they belong to, country of citizenship, and work location) for either or both painters, we explored the potential ways in which such gaps could be filled.

Explore our website to follow our thought process, the steps we went through during our research, and the achieved results.

## Goal of the project
By focusing on these two painters, we aim not only to celebrate our regional identities, but also to bring greater awareness to the artists' achievements. Our goal is to explore the ways to enrich the Knowledge Graph Wikidata with the identified missing information, which could perhaps contribute to a broader appreciation of Italy’s rich and diverse artistic heritage. In doing so, we hope to encourage others to rediscover these important, yet overlooked, figures.
